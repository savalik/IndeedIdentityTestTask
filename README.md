# IndeedIdentityTestTask
Simple web api.

Api described by Swashbuckle package: 
http://localhost:5000/swager

Since the task was not required to provide the ability to create users - there is only one hardcoded user:
http://localhost:5000/wallet/7tB8T_pVpE_m84qiEhls9g

If you like use Postman for check this api - I prepared collection for import to Postman:
